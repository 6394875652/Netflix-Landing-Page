            Explain binomial heap and properties of binomial tree.
    Answer
    Binomial heap :
    1. Binomial heap is a type of data structure which keeps data sorted and
    allows insertion and deletion in amortized time.
    2. A binomial heap is implemented as a collection of binomial tree.
    Properties of binomial tree :
    1. The total number of nodes at order k are 2k
    .
    2. The height of the tree is k.
    3. There are exactly
    k
    i
     
        i.e., 
    kCi
     nodes at depth i for i = 0, 1, …. , k (this is
    why the tree is called a “binomial” tree).
    4. Root has degree k (children) and its children are Bk-1, Bk-2, …, B0
